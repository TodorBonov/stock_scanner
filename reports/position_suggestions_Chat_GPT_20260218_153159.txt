CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
## RWED
- **My action:** **REDUCE / EXIT on next strength**
- **Agree/disagree with rule:** **Disagree (rule says HOLD)** — with an **F grade** and only **+1%** cushion, this is dead money unless it’s setting up in a clean base (no chart data provided). In SEPA, I’d rather recycle capital into A/B setups.
- **Reasoning (SEPA lens):** Low-quality scan grade + no evidence of a proper base/pivot/volume signature = low expectancy. If you keep it, it should be because it’s **tight, above rising MAs, and near a pivot**—we don’t have that confirmation.
- **What to watch:** Provide/verify **50/200DMA location**, **base high/low**, and whether it’s **tightening** with **volume contraction**. If it can’t reclaim/hold key MAs and build a base, it’s a sell.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **49.29**
  2) **SEPA/chart-based stop:** *Need base low / key MA data.* If you send it, I’d place the “must-hold” just **below the base low** (or **below the 50DMA** if that’s the key support) to avoid getting chopped by arbitrary %.

## WTAI
- **My action:** **EXIT**
- **Agree/disagree with rule:** **Agree (EXIT)** — and I’d treat this as **broken/invalid data** because your chart levels show a ~$30 stock while your position shows ~$75. Something is mismatched (ticker, split, ADR, wrong feed).
- **Reasoning (SEPA lens):** Even ignoring the mismatch, price is **at the stop (74.72)** and the position is **-5%**. SEPA rule: **no babysitting laggards**—sell when it hits the stop/violates must-hold support.
- **What to watch:** First, **fix the data issue** (confirm correct instrument). If the *real* chart is near a base pivot, you only re-enter on a **proper breakout through pivot** with **volume expansion** (typically >1.5–2.0x 20D avg).
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **74.72** (you’re essentially there → execute)
  2) **SEPA/chart-based stop (using provided levels, but likely mismatched):** **29.14** (base low “must-hold”), or tighter **below 50DMA 29.38** *if* that’s the correct chart. Again: verify ticker/price first.

## TTWO
- **My action:** **EXIT / REDUCE heavily**
- **Agree/disagree with rule:** **Disagree (rule says HOLD)** — your scan says **below both 50DMA (237) and 200DMA (238.72)**, which is **not SEPA-compliant** for a long swing position.
- **Reasoning (SEPA lens):** A stock trading **under the 50/200** is typically in a downtrend/distribution phase. With only **+0.4%** profit, there’s no reason to “hope” it comes back—capital is better deployed in leaders above rising MAs.
- **What to watch:** For any re-entry, you want: **reclaim 50DMA**, then **200DMA**, then form a **proper base** and break a **clean pivot** on volume. Without base/pivot data, I can’t define the exact add point.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **183.82**
  2) **SEPA/chart-based stop:** Since it’s already **below 50/200**, the SEPA “must-hold” is effectively **a reclaim level, not a stop**. If you insist on holding, I’d use a **tight stop just below the most recent swing low** (needs chart), or simply **exit now** because the trend filter is violated.

## PFED
- **My action:** **HOLD (but don’t add)**
- **Agree/disagree with rule:** **Agree (HOLD)** — but it’s a **low-urgency** position unless it’s acting like a leader (no grade/levels provided).
- **Reasoning (SEPA lens):** Small gain, no setup info. Holding is fine if it’s **above rising 50DMA** and tightening; otherwise it’s another candidate to rotate out.
- **What to watch:** Need **50/200DMA**, **base high/low**, and whether it’s **tight** with **volume contraction**. If it starts losing the 50DMA or breaks the base, don’t “average down.”
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **21.91**
  2) **SEPA/chart-based stop:** *Need base/MA data.* Typically **just below base low** (must-hold) or **below the 50DMA** if that’s the key support.

## TXT
- **My action:** **HOLD (possible ADD only on clean breakout)**
- **Agree/disagree with rule:** **Agree (HOLD)** — this is the only one close to a **real pivot** with supportive trend filters (**above 50DMA and 200DMA**).
- **Reasoning (SEPA lens):** Price **100.12** is **just below pivot 100.92**. That’s constructive. Volume recently **0.86x** (quiet) — fine *pre-breakout*, but you want **expansion on the breakout**.
- **What to watch (key levels):**
  - **Pivot / buy point:** **100.92** (prefer a decisive move through it)
  - **Add trigger:** Breakout through **100.92** with **volume ≥ 1.5x** 20D avg (or strong price spread/close near highs even if volume is just >1.2x in a slow tape)
  - **Must-hold support:** Ideally **hold above 50DMA 90.82**; if it breaks the pivot and fails back into the base on volume, that’s a yellow flag.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **92.96**
  2) **SEPA/chart-based stop:** **90.82 (50DMA “must-hold”)** for a tighter, trend-based stop. If you want it looser/position-trade style, then below a confirmed **base low**—but your base low **79.00** is very wide (too much risk for a swing).

### One portfolio-level note (SEPA risk hygiene)
Right now you have **multiple F-grade holds**. In Minervini-style execution, that’s usually a sign to **raise cash and concentrate in the one/two names closest to proper pivots (TXT)**, rather than spreading risk across low-quality setups.

If you paste RWED + PFED **50/200DMA + base high/low + recent swing low**, I’ll give exact SEPA “must-hold” levels and a proper pivot/add plan for those too.
