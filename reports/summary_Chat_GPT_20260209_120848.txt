## TOP 10 PICKS — DETAILED SUMMARY (ranked by SEPA quality *within your A/A+ list*)

**Important context:** none of the names in your A/A+ list are *currently in a valid breakout* by Minervini rules (no stock is ≥2% above pivot with confirming volume). So these “Top 10” are **best-quality *candidates*** based on: (1) clean Stage 2 structure, (2) tight/controlled base (depth/length/close position), (3) RS/RS Rating where available, and (4) best proximity to pivot with least “red flags” (volume not drying, RSI weak, RS failing, etc.).  
**Entry prices below are the official pivots you provided** (trigger entries), not “buy now” recommendations.

| Rank | Ticker | Company | Why It's a Top Pick | Entry Price | Stop Loss (Tight) | Stop Loss (Base Low) | Target 1 | Risk/Reward |
|------|--------|---------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | HSBA.L | HSBC Holdings | Strong Stage 2, RSI>60, good base depth/length, RS Rating 83; clean MA stack | 1320.40 | 1254.38 | 1163.20 | 1452.44 | ~2.0 |
| 2 | GLE.PA | Société Générale | Elite RS Rating 100 + RSI>60; base depth controlled; near pivot | 77.34 | 73.47 | 67.32 | 85.07 | ~2.0 |
| 3 | INGA.AS | ING Groep | RS Rating 100 + RSI>60; base depth ~10.7% and closes strong | 26.44 | 25.12 | 23.61 | 29.09 | ~2.0 |
| 4 | SAN.MC | Banco Santander | RS Rating 100; strong trend/structure; base depth controlled | 11.26 | 10.70 | 9.93 | 12.39 | ~2.0 |
| 5 | LLOY.L | Lloyds Banking | RS Rating 98.5 + RSI ~60; base depth controlled; strong uptrend | 114.60 | 108.87 | 100.11 | 126.06 | ~2.0 |
| 6 | BARC.L | Barclays | Base depth 9% (tight), RS Rating 90.8; trend strong | 506.40 | 481.08 | 461.05 | 557.04 | ~2.0 |
| 7 | PZU.WA | PZU (Insurance) | Tight 4-week base (7.5%); RSI>60; good RS Rating 87.4 | 72.72 | 69.08 | 67.28 | 79.99 | ~2.0 |
| 8 | BBVA.MC | BBVA | Very strong volume contraction (0.49x) + RS Rating 92.4; base depth controlled | 22.33 | 21.21 | 19.61 | 24.56 | ~2.0 |
| 9 | ROG.SW | Roche | Tight 4-week base, strong close position (70%); defensive leader | 362.30 | 344.18 | 331.20 | 398.53 | ~2.0 |
| 10 | NOVN.SW | Novartis | RSI very strong (77.6), controlled base; defensive rotation candidate | 121.40 | 115.33 | 107.68 | 133.54 | ~2.0 |

### Brief narratives (Top 10)

**1) HSBA.L** – Base is 6 weeks and ~11.9% deep (good), with strong MA alignment (50>150>200) and RSI 69.2 supporting momentum. The **last strong support** is the 50SMA (~1186) and the **base low** at 1163.2 for a wider stop. It stands out because it actually passes RS/RS Rating meaningfully versus its benchmark (RS Rating 83) while many others fail RS in your feed. Watch for a **proper breakout close above 1320.4 + volume expansion** (currently volume increase is weak).

**2) GLE.PA** – 6-week base, ~13% depth, closes in upper half (61%), and **RS Rating 100** is a major differentiator. Alternative support is the 50SMA (~68.2) and base low 67.32. It stands out as one of the few with both **RS and RSI>60**. Concern: base volume contraction is borderline (0.96x) and “heavy sell volume detected” flag—demand must show up on breakout.

**3) INGA.AS** – 6-week, ~10.7% base with decent close position (59.5%) and RSI 60.9; trend is clean Stage 2. Support: 50SMA ~24.01 and base low 23.61. It stands out with **RS Rating 100** and good structural health. Watch for a decisive push through 26.44 with volume (currently volume expansion is lacking).

**4) SAN.MC** – 6-week base, ~11.8% depth, strong RS Rating 100 and strong prior advance from lows. Support: 50SMA ~10.15 and base low 9.93. It stands out as a liquid leader in its market with strong RS vs benchmark. Concern: RSI is **just under** the 60 threshold (59.9) and breakout volume is not yet there.

**5) LLOY.L** – 4-week base, ~12.6% depth, strong RS Rating 98.5 and RSI barely qualifies (60.2). Support: 50SMA ~100.24 and base low 100.11. It stands out for RS strength and clean MA stack. Concern: **volume not contracting** in base (1.19x), so you want to see drying volume before the breakout attempt.

**6) BARC.L** – 6-week base, shallow 9% depth (good), RS Rating 90.8; trend is strong. Support: 50SMA ~468 and base low 461.05. It stands out for base tightness and RS. Concern: RSI is weak (50.9) and breakout volume is currently poor.

**7) PZU.WA** – Tight 4-week base (7.5% depth) with RSI 61.6 and RS Rating 87.4; trend is constructive. Support: 50SMA ~67.48 and base low 67.28. It stands out for **tightness** and decent RS. Concern: “volume not dry in base” flag (1.17x) and no breakout confirmation yet.

**8) BBVA.MC** – 6-week base, ~12.2% depth, and **excellent volume contraction** (0.49x) which is a plus for SEPA. Support: 50SMA ~20.15 and base low 19.61. It stands out because the base is behaving correctly from a supply/demand standpoint. Concern: RSI is weak (47.7) and “heavy sell volume” flag—needs clean demand on breakout.

**9) ROG.SW** – 4-week base, ~8.6% depth with very strong close position (70.5%)—that’s “tight and high.” Support: 50SMA ~332 and base low 331.2. It stands out as a defensive mega-cap that can work when risk appetite is mixed. Concern: RSI is under 60 (57.2) and volume contraction is not ideal (1.03x).

**10) NOVN.SW** – 6-week base, ~11.3% depth, RSI 77.6 (strong momentum) and trend is clean. Support: 50SMA ~111.2 and base low 107.68. It stands out for momentum/defensive leadership potential. Concern: base volume contraction is poor (1.16x), so it’s more “momentum grind” than classic SEPA dry-up.

## PRE-BREAKOUT WATCHLIST (best positioned from your PRE-BREAKOUT SETUPS list)

These are **within ~0% to ~-2.5% of pivot** and have the best combination of base validity + trend. (Many B-grade names fail close-position/RS/volume contraction; I’m prioritizing the cleaner A-grade pre-breakouts.)

| Ticker | Company | Pivot | Distance to Pivot | Why strong | What to watch |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| DAY | Dayforce | 69.86 | 0.0% | Tight area at highs; trend up; volume spike potential | Needs **close ≥ +2% above pivot** and hold; avoid “pop and drop” |
| ALEX | Alexander & Baldwin | 20.86 | -0.5% | Very tight base; above MAs | Needs RS improvement + volume confirmation |
| GTLS | Chart Industries | 208.24 | -0.4% | Tight base; near pivot; trend strong | Must clear pivot with **clean volume**; watch sell-volume flags |
| NVRI | Enviri | 19.42 | -0.4% | Strong trend; near pivot | Needs RS confirmation + volume expansion |
| ECPG | Encore Capital | 57.84 | -0.2% | Good base depth/length; constructive | Breakout must be decisive; watch liquidity/volatility |
| MAR | Marriott | 333.96 | -0.2% | Clean Stage 2; base valid | Needs RS/volume confirmation on breakout day |
| IBE.MC | Iberdrola | 19.45 | -0.2% | Tight base; RSI strong; defensive utility | Volume dry-up is poor—prefer breakout on expansion |
| TD | Toronto-Dominion | 96.74 | -0.1% | Very tight base (4.7%); near pivot | Needs volume + RS confirmation (scanner RS failing) |
| BK | BNY Mellon | 125.33 | -0.8% | Tight base; near pivot | Needs RSI>60 + volume expansion |
| BNS | Scotiabank | 76.56 | -0.3% | Tight base; near pivot | Needs volume dry-up (currently poor) |
| PZU.WA | PZU | 72.72 | -1.2% | Tight base; RSI>60 | Watch for breakout volume + market confirmation |
| ROG.SW | Roche | 362.30 | -2.4% | Tight base; strong close position | Needs RSI improvement + volume |
| ROST | Ross Stores | 194.92 | -2.1% | Tight base; trend intact | Needs RS/RSI improvement + volume |
| RY | Royal Bank of Canada | 174.61 | -2.4% | Tight base; trend intact | Needs RS/RSI improvement + volume |
| ISP.MI | Intesa Sanpaolo | 6.16 | -2.7% | Tight base; trend intact | Needs RS data + volume confirmation |

# FULL A/A+ LIST — DETAILED SEPA ANALYSIS (per stock)

> **Note on RS failures in your feed:** Many US/UK names show “Relative Strength = 0.0000 / benchmark return 0.00%” which looks like a **data/benchmark mapping issue** (you used ^GDAXI for many US stocks). I will still respect the scanner’s checklist: if RS is marked failed, I treat it as **not A+** and as a real risk (because SEPA requires leadership/RS confirmation).

---

## PFE — Pfizer (Grade A)

1) **Overall assessment:** Agree with **A (not A+)**. Structure/base are fine, but RS + breakout confirmation are missing.  
2) **Why not A+:**  
   - **RS failed:** not outperforming benchmark; RS Rating 50.  
   - **Breakout rules failed:** not ≥2% above pivot; no breakout close/volume confirmation.  
3) **Stage 2?** Yes: price above 50/150/200 with proper MA order.  
4) **Base quality:** Valid 4-week base, depth 10.3% (good), volume contraction good.  
5) **Relative strength:** Weak per scanner (RS fail).  
6) **Volume:** Base contraction OK; breakout volume requirement not met.  
7) **Breakout:** Not in breakout (below pivot).  
8) **Key risks:** RS lag (non-leader), “late stage” risk near 52W high, defensive/slow mover.  
9) **Recommendation:** **Half or None** until it clears pivot with volume; prefer leaders.  
10) **Levels:** Pivot **27.37**; Buy zone **27.37–28.19** (+0 to +3%); Tight stop **26.00**; Base low stop **24.56**; Last strong support/disaster **19.50**; Targets **30.11 / 39.69**.

---

## LLY — Eli Lilly (Grade A)

1) **Overall assessment:** A is reasonable; trend strong but entry is **not triggered** and RS/RSI flags in checklist.  
2) **Why not A+:** RS failed (scanner), **RSI(14)=52.5** below threshold, breakout rules failed; “heavy sell volume detected.”  
3) **Stage 2?** Yes (above rising MAs, correct order).  
4) **Base:** 6 weeks, 12.4% depth (good).  
5) **RS:** Failed per scanner (data/benchmark issue likely, but still a fail).  
6) **Volume:** Contraction good; but sell-volume flag is a concern.  
7) **Breakout:** Not.  
8) **Risks:** Extended/late-stage risk, volatility around news, failure risk if it can’t reclaim pivot.  
9) **Recommendation:** **Half** only on proper breakout; otherwise wait.  
10) **Levels:** Pivot **1133.95**; Buy **1133.95–1167.97**; Tight stop **1077.25**; Base low stop **993.58**; Disaster **621.50**; Targets **1247.34 / 1644.23**.

## If you want this to be *actionable* SEPA (next step)
If you share **(a)** which market you actually trade (US vs Europe), and **(b)** a consistent benchmark per region (e.g., SPY for US, STOXX600 for EU, FTSE100 for UK), I can **recompute leadership/RS ranking** and re-rank the Top 10 more accurately. Right now, many “RS failures” look like benchmark/data artifacts, and SEPA selection quality depends heavily on correct RS/leadership.
