CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
## WTAI
**Suggested action:** **EXIT**  
**Agree/disagree with report:** **Agree** (and I’d act on it)  
**Reasoning (SEPA):** Your scan data shows a constructive base/pivot around **$31.50**, but your position prices (**entry 78.65 / current 74.89**) don’t match the chart levels provided (50/200 DMA ~ $29/$26). That mismatch makes the technical levels unusable for risk management. Separately, the report grade is **F** and you’re already down ~5%—Minervini-style, weak names get cut quickly and capital is recycled into A/B setups.  
**What to watch:**  
- Verify you’re looking at the correct instrument (ticker/class/venue) and timeframe.  
- If the *correct* WTAI chart is actually the one with pivot **31.50**, then the only “SEPA-valid” long is **on/after a breakout above 31.50 with volume**, not while it’s below/extended.

**Stop loss (based on data you provided):** *Not reliable due to price/level mismatch.*  
- If (and only if) the correct traded instrument is the one with **pivot $31.50 / base low $29.14**, then a SEPA “must-hold” stop would be **~$29.10** (just under base low).  
- With your actual position trading ~**$75**, I can’t responsibly set a stop from $29-level data. If you confirm the correct 50/200DMA and base levels for the $75 chart, I’ll give a precise must-hold stop.

**Optional profit targets (if using the $31.50 pivot chart):** first trim zone **+10–20%** above pivot (roughly **$34.65–$37.80**) if it breaks out properly.

## PFED
**Suggested action:** **HOLD** (lean HOLD/REDUCE if it’s dead money)  
**Agree/disagree with report:** **Mostly agree** (HOLD is fine, but only if trend/base are intact)  
**Reasoning (SEPA):** You didn’t provide PFED’s 50/200DMA, base levels, or volume behavior. With only +2% open profit and no technical context, the SEPA approach is: **hold only if it’s above rising 50DMA and acting well; otherwise don’t babysit a low-momentum position**.  
**What to watch (to decide HOLD vs REDUCE/EXIT):**  
- Is price **above a rising 50DMA** and preferably **above 200DMA**?  
- Is it forming a **tight base** (volatility contraction) or just drifting?  
- Any **earnings/news** catalyst risk (if applicable).

**Stop loss (practical, given limited data):**  
- If you want a rules-based risk cap without chart levels: **$22.15** (about **-6%** from your entry 23.07; aligns with typical SEPA-style max loss discipline).  
- If you share PFED base low / 50DMA, I’d anchor the stop **just below the base low or 50DMA** (whichever is tighter but still “must-hold”).

**Optional profit targets:** If it breaks out of a base, consider trimming **+10–20%** from a proper pivot; otherwise no target—manage by price/volume.

## TXT
**Suggested action:** **HOLD** (ADD only on a proper breakout)  
**Agree/disagree with report:** **Agree** (hold/trim on strength is reasonable)  
**Reasoning (SEPA):** TXT is **above rising 50DMA ($90.50) and 200DMA ($82.52)**—trend is supportive. But it’s **below the pivot $100.92** and volume is **subpar (0.88x vs 20d avg)** with no breakout volume confirmation. That’s “in position, but not in add mode.”  
**What to watch:**  
- **Pivot / add trigger:** A decisive breakout **above $100.92** with **volume expansion** (ideally >1.5–2.0x 20-day average).  
- **Must-hold support:** **$90.50 (50DMA)** is the key intermediate trend line; losing it on heavy volume is a yellow/red flag.  
- Watch for **tightening** (narrow ranges) as it approaches pivot—good sign.

**Stop loss price (SEPA-style must-hold):**  
- Primary stop: **$89.90** (just below the **50DMA $90.50** to avoid getting shaken out by a penny).  
- If you want a wider “base failure” stop: **$78.90** (just below base low **$79.00**), but that’s very wide relative to your entry and not very SEPA-efficient.

**Optional profit targets:**  
- If it breaks out over **$100.92**, first trim zone **~$111–$121** (+10–20% from pivot) assuming it’s a clean breakout with strong volume.

### One clarification that would materially improve stops/add points
For **WTAI**, please confirm the correct chart levels for the instrument you actually hold (50/200DMA, base high/low) because the provided levels (~$30) don’t match your position price (~$75). Once corrected, I can give a precise SEPA pivot/add plan and a true “must-hold” stop.
