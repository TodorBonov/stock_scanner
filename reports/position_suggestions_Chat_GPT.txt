CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
## WTAI — **EXIT**
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Agree** (rule says EXIT; I agree).
- **Why (SEPA/risk):** You’re already **through your max-loss line** (down -5.4% vs 5% stop). In SEPA, **small losses are non-negotiable**—especially with a **scan grade F**. Also, the chart/level data you provided (50/200/base ~$29–31) clearly **doesn’t match** your position price (~$74–79), which is a red flag that the level set may be for a different instrument/timeframe or bad mapping—so I would not “give it room” based on those levels.
- **What to watch (if you want back on it):**
  - Only reconsider on a **proper base + clean pivot breakout** with **volume expansion** (ideally >1.5–2.0x 20D avg) and RS improvement.
  - If the correct pivot/base is known for *your* traded WTAI price series, use that; otherwise don’t average down.

**Stops**
1) **Your guideline stop (from report):** **74.72** (already effectively triggered; exit now rather than “hoping”).
2) **SEPA/chart-based stop (must-hold):** Because the provided base/MA levels (~$29–31) are inconsistent with your traded prices, I **can’t responsibly set a chart stop** from that data.  
   - If you supply the **correct base low / 50DMA / 200DMA near $70–$80**, the SEPA stop would typically be **just below the base low** (or below the 50DMA if that’s the key support), usually **~1–3% under** that must-hold level.

## PFED — **HOLD** (no add)
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Agree** (rule says HOLD; I agree).
- **Why (SEPA/risk):** You’re **+1.6%**, sitting **7% above your stop**, and there’s no breakout/pivot data provided to justify adding. In SEPA terms: **hold** if it’s acting fine, but **don’t add without a proper setup** (tight base, pivot, volume confirmation, RS).
- **What to watch:**
  - If it forms a **tight consolidation** and then clears a **defined pivot** on volume, that’s your add trigger.
  - If it starts losing key support (prior base lows / key MAs), be quicker to reduce—this looks more like a “wait for confirmation” hold than an “add” hold.

**Stops**
1) **Your guideline stop (from report):** **21.91**
2) **SEPA/chart-based stop (must-hold):** Not enough chart levels provided. Best practice:
   - **Below the most recent swing low / base low** that defines the current structure (the level that, if broken, invalidates the setup).
   - If you share PFED’s **50DMA/200DMA and base low**, I’ll pin an exact must-hold level and a clean “line in the sand.”

## TXT — **HOLD** (watch for pivot; add only on breakout)
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Mostly agree** (rule says HOLD/trim on strength; I’d **HOLD**, not trim yet, unless it rejects the pivot).
- **Why (SEPA/risk):**
  - Price is **above 50DMA (90.50) and 200DMA (82.52)** → trend support is constructive.
  - You’re near flat (+0.4%), and the **pivot is 100.92**. This is close enough that the correct play is: **hold and see if it can break out**.
  - Volume is **0.88x vs 20D avg** recently → not showing demand yet. I would **not add** until it clears the pivot with real volume.
- **What to watch (key levels / triggers):**
  - **Add trigger (SEPA):** A decisive move **through 100.92** (pivot) with **volume expansion** (ideally **≥1.5x** 20D avg) and strong close.
  - **Must-hold support:** **50DMA ~90.50** is the first “line.” If it loses that and can’t reclaim quickly, odds of a failed setup rise.
  - If it breaks out and then **fails back below 100.92** on volume, treat as a potential **failed breakout** (often a sell/trim signal).

**Stops**
1) **Your guideline stop (from report):** **92.96**
2) **SEPA/chart-based stop (must-hold):**
   - **More conservative (trend-based):** just below the **50DMA (90.50)** (give a little room under it).
   - **Structure-based (wider, if you’re allowing base-level risk):** below the **base low 79.00** (this is usually too wide for SEPA position sizing unless the position is small).

### One quick data issue to fix
WTAI’s scan levels (pivot ~$31, 50DMA ~$29) don’t align with your WTAI position price (~$74–$79). Before you rely on any SEPA pivots/stops for WTAI, confirm:
- correct ticker/exchange (ADR vs local, split-adjusted data),
- timeframe used for base detection,
- whether the scan pulled the wrong instrument.

If you paste PFED’s 50/200DMA + base high/low (and confirm WTAI’s correct levels), I can give exact **pivot add points** and **must-hold stops** for all three.
