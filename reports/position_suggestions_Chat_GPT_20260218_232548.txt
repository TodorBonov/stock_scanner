CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
## RWED — **REDUCE / EXIT on strength**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** HOLD — **Disagree**
- **Why (SEPA/risk):** Scan grade **F** + only **+1.6%** cushion. In SEPA, low-grade/lagging names are “opportunity cost” unless they’re acting like leaders (tight, above key MAs, setting up). You didn’t provide MA/base data for RWED, so I can’t justify giving it leash.
- **What to watch:** If it can’t push through/hold a clear resistance area (prior highs) on **expanding volume**, it’s dead money. Any heavy-volume down day is a warning to exit.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **49.29**
  2) **SEPA/chart stop (needs levels):** Use the **low of the most recent tight area/base** or **rising 50 DMA** (whichever is higher). If you share RWED 50/200 DMA + base low/high, I’ll set a precise “must-hold” level.

## WTAI — **EXIT**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** EXIT — **Agree**
- **Why (SEPA/risk):** Your chart data is internally inconsistent with your position prices (scan shows ~$30 levels while position shows ~$76), so I can’t trust the pivot/MA numbers for execution. But independent of that: **grade F**, **down -3.3%**, and you’re only **~1.8% above your stop**. In SEPA, weak names near the stop get cut—no “hope hold.”
- **What to watch (if you insist on giving it one more day):** Must reclaim a key level quickly (prior day high / short-term MA) on **strong volume**; otherwise it’s just bleeding time and risk.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **74.72** (I’d treat this as a hard stop)
  2) **SEPA/chart stop:** Because the scan levels don’t match the traded price, I can’t give a valid MA/base stop. If you provide correct **50/200 DMA + base low** for the ~$76 chart, the SEPA stop is typically **just below base low** (or **below 50 DMA** if that’s the must-hold).

## TTWO — **REDUCE (or HOLD only if it reclaims key MAs quickly)**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** HOLD — **Disagree (lean reduce)**
- **Why (SEPA/risk):** Grade **F** and (per your scan) price is **below both 50 DMA (236) and 200 DMA (238)**—that’s classic “below the line” behavior. Even though your position is green (+3%), SEPA wants you in names **above rising MAs**, not under them. This looks like a laggard/weak trend condition.
- **What to watch:** A **reclaim of the 50/200 DMA zone** and then **holding above it** for several sessions (ideally with accumulation volume). If it rallies into that zone and stalls, that’s a good **sell-into-strength** spot.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **183.82**
  2) **SEPA/chart stop:** “Must-hold” = **recent swing low** (the low of the last 1–3 weeks) or the **200 DMA** if it reclaims it. Right now, since it’s below both MAs, I’d keep a **tighter stop than your % rule**—typically **just under the most recent swing low** to avoid riding a deeper downtrend.

## PFED — **HOLD (but don’t add)**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** HOLD — **Agree**
- **Why (SEPA/risk):** Small gain (+0.3%) and no setup data provided (trend/base/volume). With no evidence it’s a leader or breaking out, it’s a **hold-at-best**—not an add.
- **What to watch:** Look for a **proper base** (tightening ranges, volume contraction) and then a **breakout through pivot on volume**. If it chops and underperforms the market, consider reallocating.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **21.91**
  2) **SEPA/chart stop (needs levels):** Ideally **just below base low** or **below rising 50 DMA**. Share PFED 50/200 + base high/low and I’ll set the exact must-hold.

## TXT — **HOLD (ADD only on a proper breakout)**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** HOLD — **Agree**
- **Why (SEPA/risk):** Grade **B** and price is **above 50 DMA (91.16) and 200 DMA (82.81)**—this is the only one here that clearly meets the “above key MAs” trend filter. But you didn’t provide base/pivot levels, so I won’t recommend adding blindly.
- **What to watch (SEPA-style):**
  - **Add trigger:** A **clean breakout** through a defined pivot (base high) with **volume expansion** (ideally >1.5–2.0x 50-day avg).
  - **Must-hold:** The **50 DMA (~91.16)** is the key institutional line. A decisive break below it on volume is a sell/trim signal.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Guideline stop (your rule):** **92.96**
  2) **SEPA/chart stop:** **Just below the 50 DMA (~91.16)** or below the **base low** (if higher than the 50 DMA). Since your rule-stop (92.96) is *above* the 50 DMA, it’s already fairly tight; SEPA stop would usually be **~1–3% under the 50 DMA** to avoid getting shaken out, *unless* the base low is tighter/higher.

### Two quick data fixes that would let me be more precise
1) **WTAI price mismatch:** confirm the correct ticker/price feed (your position ~$76 vs scan ~$30).  
2) For **RWED/PFED/TXT**, send **base high (pivot), base low, and whether 50/200 DMA are rising**—then I can give exact SEPA pivot/add points and “must-hold” levels.
