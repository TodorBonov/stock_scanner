CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
### WTAI — **EXIT**
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Agree (EXIT)**
- **Reasoning (SEPA-style):** Grade **F** + you’re **sitting ~0.2% above your stop**. That’s “no-man’s land” risk: if it breaks, you’ll likely get slipped below the stop and take a larger-than-planned loss. In SEPA terms, this isn’t acting like a leader (weak relative strength/quality setup implied by the grade), and it’s not in a constructive base/breakout posture.
- **What to watch:**  
  - **74.72** is the line in the sand. If you *don’t* exit now, at minimum treat a decisive break below **74.7** as an automatic sell.  
  - Only reconsider later if it **reclaims key moving averages** and forms a **tight base** with **volume drying up on pullbacks** and **expanding on up days** (i.e., evidence of institutional support).

### PFED — **HOLD (no add yet)**
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Agree (HOLD)**
- **Reasoning (SEPA-style):** You’re up ~2% and **7.4% above the stop**, so the trade isn’t under immediate pressure. But it’s also **not through a clear breakout/trigger** (you’re still ~7.8% from Target 1), so adding here would be “adding in the middle,” which SEPA generally avoids unless it’s a proper add point (tight action near highs after a breakout).
- **What to watch:**  
  - **25.37 (Target 1 / likely resistance area):** If it approaches this level, watch for **tight closes** and **volume expansion** through resistance—*that* would be a more valid add/hold-through moment.  
  - **21.91 stop:** If it starts losing support and closes weakly for multiple days, consider reducing risk before the stop (especially if the market tape worsens).  
  - Any **yield/credit** macro shifts (if PFED is rate-sensitive) that could change character quickly.

### TXT — **HOLD (trim only if it fails near resistance)**
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Mostly agree (HOLD), with a conditional trim**
- **Reasoning (SEPA-style):** Grade **C** suggests it’s not a top-tier leader, but you’re basically flat and **not near the stop**. This is a “prove it” hold: keep it as long as it acts right, but don’t give it much room if it starts lagging. I would **not add** until it shows a clean breakout or strong RS improvement.
- **What to watch:**  
  - **107.64 (Target 1 / likely prior resistance):** If it rallies toward that zone and **stalls on heavier volume** (distribution) or repeatedly rejects, consider **reducing** into strength.  
  - **92.96 stop:** If it breaks key support/MA structure and heads toward this, don’t rationalize—exit per plan.  
  - Look for **tight weekly closes**, **higher lows**, and **volume confirmation** on any breakout attempt; otherwise it’s capital that could be in a stronger name.

If you share the **daily/weekly charts** (or at least 50/200DMA location + recent base highs/lows + volume trend), I can tighten these into specific SEPA-style pivot/add points and “must-hold” levels.
