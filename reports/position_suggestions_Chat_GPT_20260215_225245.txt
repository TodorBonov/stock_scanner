CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
### WTAI — **EXIT**
- **Agree/Disagree with report:** **Agree** (EXIT)
- **Reasoning (SEPA):** Your price/entry data (78.65 → 74.89) doesn’t match the chart levels provided (pivot ~31.50), but *based on your actual position* you’re **sitting ~0.2% above your stop (74.72)** and already down **-4.8%**. In Minervini-style risk control, when you’re this close to the line **you don’t “hope”**—you either sell now or you’re effectively committing to being stopped. Also, the scan shows **no breakout confirmation** (breakout volume ratio 0.00x), so there’s no technical justification to “give it room.”
- **Action:** **EXIT now** (or at minimum, treat **74.72 as a hard line** and be out on any decisive break).
- **What to watch (if you want back in):**
  - **SEPA pivot:** ~**31.50** *from your scan* (but verify the ticker/price feed mismatch first).
  - **Proper re-entry trigger:** reclaim of the pivot with **volume expansion** (ideally **≥1.5–2.0x** 20-day average) and tight closes.
  - **Must-hold (if re-entered):** just below the pivot / top of base (or a tight % stop per your rules).  
  - **Important note:** Please **reconcile the symbol/price discrepancy** (your position trades ~75, scan shows ~30s). If the scan is for a different listing/ETF, the pivot/DMAs are not usable.

### PFED — **HOLD**
- **Agree/Disagree with report:** **Agree** (HOLD)
- **Reasoning (SEPA):** You’re up **+2%**, sitting **7.4% above your stop**, and **~7.8% below Target 1**. With no chart/base/volume data provided, there’s no evidence of a clean add point. In SEPA terms: **hold winners**, don’t add without a **proper pivot** and **volume confirmation**.
- **Action:** **HOLD** (no add until it proves itself).
- **What to watch:**
  - **Key level:** **25.37 (Target 1)** — if it approaches/clears this area, watch for **tight price action** and **volume expansion** (that’s where an “add” could become valid).
  - **Must-hold:** **21.91 stop** (or raise stop if it gets extended and then tightens up).
  - If you can share: **50/200 DMA, base pivot/high-low, and volume trend**, I can give a true SEPA pivot/add and a tighter must-hold level.

### TXT — **HOLD (with conditional ADD only on breakout)**
- **Agree/Disagree with report:** **Mostly agree** (HOLD; “trim on strength” only if it gets extended)
- **Reasoning (SEPA):**
  - Trend is constructive: **above 50 DMA (90.50) and 200 DMA (82.52)**.
  - It’s **below the base pivot 100.92**, so it’s **not in breakout mode yet**.
  - Volume is **light (0.88x vs 20d avg)** and breakout volume ratio is **0.00x**, so there’s **no confirmation** to add right now.
- **Action:** **HOLD**. **ADD only if** it breaks out correctly.
- **What to watch (SEPA levels):**
  - **Pivot / buy point:** **100.92** (base high).
  - **Add trigger:** a **decisive close above 100.92** with **volume expansion** (ideally **≥1.5x** 20-day average). If it pokes above on weak volume and fades, that’s a pass.
  - **Must-hold (if breakout occurs):** roughly **back below 100.92** (or a tighter stop based on the breakout day low). If it breaks out and quickly loses the pivot, that’s a classic failed breakout risk.
  - **Support to monitor now:** **50 DMA ~90.50** (trend support). A clean break below the 50 with deterioration would be a warning to reduce/exit depending on your rules and market conditions.

If you tell me (1) your **position size %** for each and (2) whether you’re willing to take **full stop-outs vs partial trims**, I can align the actions to a tighter Minervini-style risk plan (max loss per position, add sizing, and when to pyramid).
