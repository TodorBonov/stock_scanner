CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
### WTAI — **EXIT**
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Agree** (EXIT)
- **Reasoning (SEPA/risk):** You’re **sitting ~0.2% above your stop (74.72)** with a **-4.8% loss** and an **F grade**. In SEPA terms, that’s a failed/weak situation where capital is better recycled into A/B setups. Also, the chart/level data you provided for WTAI is internally inconsistent with your current price (your scan levels look like a different-priced instrument), so I can’t trust those pivots/DMAs for decision-making—making the **hard stop** even more important.
- **Actionable plan:**  
  - **Sell now** or **use a hard stop at 74.72** (no “room” left). If it tags 74.72, be out.
- **What to watch (if you want to re-enter later):**
  - A **clean base** with tightening ranges and **volume dry-up**, then a **breakout through the true pivot** on **≥1.5–2.0x** average volume.
  - Price **reclaiming and holding** key moving averages (50DMA ideally rising) *once you have correct levels*.

---

### PFED — **HOLD (no add yet)**
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Agree** (HOLD)
- **Reasoning (SEPA/risk):** You’re **+2%**, comfortably above the stop (**~7.4% cushion**), and **~7.8% from Target 1**. Without base/pivot/volume context, there’s no SEPA-style “add point” confirmation. This reads like a **fine hold**, but not an “add” until it proves strength.
- **Actionable plan:**
  - **Hold** as long as it stays constructive.
  - **No add** unless it clears a defined pivot/trigger with strong volume (needs chart levels).
  - If it runs into **Target 1 (25.37)** quickly and gets extended, consider **trimming a piece into strength** (especially if volume spikes/climactic).
- **What to watch:**
  - Whether price **tightens** and volume **contracts** before the next push (good).
  - A **decisive breakout day** (close near highs) vs. repeated stalling near resistance.
  - If it starts closing weak / breaking short-term support, respect the **21.91 stop**.

### TXT — **HOLD (watch for breakout; add only on confirmation)**
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Mostly agree** (HOLD; “trim on strength” only if it gets extended/fails)
- **Reasoning (SEPA/risk):** Price is **above rising 50DMA (90.50) and 200DMA (82.52)**—trend is supportive. It’s **near the base pivot at 100.92** but not through it yet. Volume recently is **0.88x vs 20d avg** (not showing demand), and breakout volume ratio is **0.00x** (no breakout confirmation). This is a **proper “wait at the line”** situation.
- **Key levels (SEPA-style):**
  - **Pivot / trigger:** **100.92**  
  - **Must-hold (near-term):** **50DMA ~90.50** (if it loses the 50DMA and can’t reclaim quickly, odds of a failed setup rise)
  - **Hard stop (your plan):** **92.96** (keep it; it’s consistent with risk control)
- **Actionable plan:**
  - **Hold** while it’s below pivot but acting tight.
  - **ADD only if** it **clears 100.92** and **volume expands** (ideally **≥1.5x** 20-day average) and it **closes strong** (upper part of range).
  - If it pops above 100.92 on weak volume and reverses, **do not add**; consider **reducing** if it becomes a breakout failure.
- **What to watch:**
  - **Volume signature** on any move through **100.92** (this is the tell).
  - **Tight closes** and shrinking daily ranges into the pivot (constructive).
  - Relative strength vs market/sector—if it lags while market is strong, be cautious.

#### One important note
Your **WTAI scan levels (50/200DMA, pivot ~$31.50)** don’t match the **current price ~$74.89**. If you can confirm the correct ticker/levels (or share a chart screenshot), I can give precise SEPA pivot/add zones and must-hold levels for WTAI as well.
