CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
## WTAI — **EXIT**
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Agree** (rule says EXIT).
- **Reasoning (SEPA-style):** You’re **down -4.8% and sitting on the stop** with a **scan grade F** (institutional-quality/RS/earnings/price action likely not there). In SEPA, when a position is **failing near the stop**, you don’t “give it room” unless it’s acting like a true leader and you have a clear, tight must-hold level. Also, your provided “base/pivot” data (pivot **$31.50**) doesn’t reconcile with your current price (~$74.89), which suggests either a data mismatch or the scan levels are stale/wrong ticker mapping—either way, that’s a risk-management red flag: trade what you can clearly define.
- **What to watch (if you *don’t* exit and want a last chance):**
  - **Immediate behavior around 74.7–75.0** (your stop zone). If it loses that level on any meaningful volume, it’s done.
  - If it reclaims and holds a short-term resistance (prior day highs / 10–20DMA area), only then does it earn more time—but with an F grade, I wouldn’t sponsor it.

**Stops**
1) **Per your guidelines (rule-based):** **74.72** (hard stop).
2) **SEPA/chart-based “must-hold” stop:** Without reliable base/MA levels (your scan levels look inconsistent), the only defensible SEPA stop is **just below the most recent swing low / support shelf** on the daily chart. Practically: **a close below 74.50** (or ~0.5–1% under the most recent pivot low if that’s lower). If you share the true 50/200DMA and the current base structure for WTAI at the *current* price regime, I can give a precise must-hold level.

## PFED — **HOLD** (lean **HOLD / small ADD only on strength**)
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Agree** (rule says HOLD).
- **Reasoning (SEPA-style):** You’re **+2%**, comfortably above your stop, and there’s no stated breakdown signal. However, I don’t have trend/base/MA/pivot data for PFED, so I can’t justify an “ADD” in SEPA terms unless it’s **in a confirmed uptrend above rising 50DMA** and either **breaking out** or **tightening up** near highs.
- **What to watch:**
  - **Approach to Target 1 (25.37):** If it pushes toward/through that level with **volume expansion**, that’s constructive.
  - If it starts **stalling** near highs on heavier volume (churn), consider trimming.
  - If it loses key moving averages (20/50DMA) on volume, tighten risk.

**Stops**
1) **Per your guidelines (rule-based):** **21.91**.
2) **SEPA/chart-based “must-hold” stop:** Ideally **just below the low of the current base / last tight area** or **below the 50DMA** (whichever is tighter and logical). Since you didn’t provide PFED’s base low / 50DMA, the actionable ask is: share PFED **50DMA/200DMA + base low/high** and I’ll set a precise must-hold stop (often ~1–3% below base low or 50DMA depending on volatility).

## TXT — **HOLD** (possible **ADD only if it clears pivot with volume**)
- **Agree/Disagree with rule:** **Mostly agree** (rule says HOLD; I’d keep it but be very specific about add/trim triggers).
- **Reasoning (SEPA-style):**
  - Price is **above 50DMA (90.50) and 200DMA (82.52)** → trend support is good.
  - Current price **98.27** is **below the base pivot 100.92** → not yet in breakout mode.
  - Volume info: **recent vs 20d avg 0.88x** and no breakout volume ratio → it’s **not breaking out with power yet**. That argues for **HOLD**, not ADD, until it proves itself.
- **SEPA pivot/add points:**
  - **Primary add/buy pivot:** **100.92** (base high). Prefer **decisive move through 100.92** with **volume ≥ 1.5x–2.0x** 20-day average (or at least clear expansion vs prior days).
  - If it clears 100.92 and then **retests/holds** that area tightly, a secondary add can be on the first constructive pullback that stays above the pivot/10DMA.
- **Must-hold levels / what to watch:**
  - **Must-hold #1:** **90.50 (50DMA)** — losing this on volume is a character change; I’d reduce/exit depending on severity.
  - **Must-hold #2:** **79.00 (base low)** — if it ever gets back there, the base has failed; you don’t want to be involved.
  - Watch for **tight closes** and **dry-up volume** as it approaches 100.92 (good), versus **churn** just below/at 100.92 (bad).

**Stops**
1) **Per your guidelines (rule-based):** **92.96**.
2) **SEPA/chart-based “must-hold” stop (tighter/structural):**
   - **Below the 50DMA (90.50)** is the clean structural line. I’d use **~89.90** (a little under the 50DMA to avoid stop-running), *or* a **daily close below the 50DMA** as the trigger if you prefer close-based stops.
   - If you want to give it more room (less SEPA-tight): below **base low 79.00** (but that’s very wide and usually not appropriate for a position you’re only up ~0.4%).

### One data issue to fix (important)
Your **WTAI scan levels (50DMA 29.38 / pivot 31.50)** don’t match the **current price ~74.89**. Before adding/holding anything based on those levels, confirm the ticker mapping and that the scan is pulling the correct instrument/adjusted prices. This directly affects SEPA pivots and “must-hold” stops.
