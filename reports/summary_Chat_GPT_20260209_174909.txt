## TOP 20 PICKS — DETAILED SUMMARY (ranked by SEPA/technical quality *from your A/A+ list*)

**Important context (SEPA discipline):** None of the A/A names provided are in a *confirmed breakout* per your scanner (“Clears pivot ≥2%” is false across the board). So these “Top 20” are **best-in-class candidates** *to buy only on a proper breakout* (or on a tight, low-risk entry if they reclaim the pivot with volume). Rankings below emphasize: **base validity (3–8w, ≤25% depth), tightness/close position, volume contraction, RS/RSI strength, and clean support levels**.

### Top 20 table

### Brief narratives for each Top 20 pick (3–4 sentences each)

1) **HSBA.L** – Base is a proper 6-week consolidation (11.9% depth) with good close position and contraction (0.66x), consistent with institutional “quiet” action. Last strong support is the **50SMA ~1185.86**; base low stop is **1163.20**. It stands out because it’s one of the few with **RS/RSI passing** and clean MA alignment. Watch for a **high-volume push through 1320.40**; lack of volume expansion is the main concern.

2) **INGA.AS** – 6-week base, 10.7% depth, and RS/RSI **barely passes** (RS rating 100; RSI 60.1), which is constructive. Support: **50SMA ~24.01** and base low **23.61**. It stands out as a European financial with **true outperformance vs ^AEX** and a relatively clean base. Watch for **volume dry-up improving (<0.9x)** and then a decisive close above **26.44**.

3) **GLE.PA** – 6-week base with good close position (61%) and strong RS/RSI (RS rating 100; RSI 63.3), but volume contraction is slightly off (0.97x). Support: **50SMA ~68.21** and base low **67.32**. It stands out for **strong relative performance** and a base that is not overly deep. Concern: “heavy sell volume detected” before breakout—demand must show up on the pivot.

4) **SAN.MC** – Solid 6-week base (11.8% depth) with good close position and contraction (0.70x). Support: **50SMA ~10.15** and base low **9.93**. It stands out due to **RS rating 100** and clear outperformance vs ^IBEX. Watch RSI (58.9 slightly under threshold) and require a **clean 2%+ pivot clearance** above **11.26**.

5) **BBVA.MC** – 6-week base with excellent volume contraction (0.50x) and acceptable depth (12.2%). Support: **50SMA ~20.15** and base low **19.61**. It stands out because the base is “quiet” and technically well-formed even though RSI is weak (46.7). Needs **RSI/RS improvement** and a volume-backed breakout through **22.33**.

6) **ROG.SW** – Tight 4-week base (8.6% depth) with strong close position (69.8%), a classic “tight area” setup. Support: **50SMA ~332.40** and base low **331.20**. It stands out as a defensive mega-cap with stable trend structure and relatively clean price action. Concern: RSI 59.1 slightly under threshold and volume contraction not ideal (1.03x).

7) **NOVN.SW** – 6-week base (11.3% depth) with strong close position and very strong RSI (76.9). Support: **50SMA ~111.19** and base low **107.68**. It stands out for momentum/RS vs benchmark and defensive sponsorship potential. Concern: base volume contraction is poor (1.17x) and breakout volume hasn’t appeared.

8) **UCB.BR** – 6-week base (13.9% depth) with good close position and strong contraction (0.50x). Support: **50SMA ~248.71** and base low **232.50**. It stands out fundamentally (growth) and technically (quiet base), but RS/RSI are not at A+ levels (RS rating 65; RSI 58). Watch for **RS line improvement** and a decisive move through **269.90**.

9) **EVN.VI** – 6-week base (10.3% depth) with decent contraction (0.87x) and good close position. Support: **50SMA ~27.70** and base low **26.60**. It stands out as a lower-beta utility with orderly structure. Concern: RS “at base start” was weak (49.5), so demand must confirm on breakout.

10) **ECL** – 6-week base (11% depth) with strong contraction (0.69x) and good close position (61%). Support: **50SMA ~271.26** and base low **259.14**. It stands out for classic “quality compounder” behavior and a technically valid base. Concern: RS module shows “not outperforming benchmark” (likely data issue with ^GDAXI); still require **volume expansion** above **291.08**.

11) **BA** – 4-week base (10% depth) with acceptable close position; trend structure is Stage 2 by MAs. Support: **50SMA ~223.49** and base low **228.96**. It stands out due to theme/industry interest, but RS/RSI are weak in your scan. Major concern: high leverage/debt and need for **clean institutional volume** on breakout.

12) **GE** – 6-week base (12.8% depth) with acceptable close position; trend is strong. Support: **50SMA ~306.11** and base low **290.07**. It stands out as a leadership aerospace name, but base volume contraction is poor (1.40x). Needs a **textbook breakout** above **332.79** with volume.

13) **RTX** – 6-week base (11.8% depth) with borderline close position (51.3%). Support: **50SMA ~187.14** and base low **182.17**. It stands out as a large liquid defense/aero name, but RS/RSI fail in scan and “heavy sell volume” is a yellow flag. Require a **high-volume reclaim** of **206.48**.

14) **RR.L** – 6-week base depth is fine, but **avg close position is weak (45.4%)**, implying sloppier trading inside the base. Support: **50SMA ~1183.74** and base low **1131.00**. It stands out for extreme RS rating (100) and huge prior run, but that also raises late-stage risk. Only actionable on a **clean pivot clearance** above **1306.60**.

15) **SAF.PA** – 6-week base (11.1% depth) but volume contraction is poor (1.22x) and RSI is weak (44.1). Support: **50SMA ~303.86** and base low **293.10**. It stands out for aerospace leadership potential and strong outperformance vs ^FCHI, but it’s not “tight/quiet” enough. Needs **dry-up + RSI improvement** before breakout.

16) **BARC.L** – 6-week base (9% depth) with contraction (0.71x) and just-barely acceptable close position (50.3%). Support: **50SMA ~467.92** and base low **461.05**. It stands out for a tight base and strong trend, but RSI is weak (45.4) and breakout volume is absent. Watch for **volume surge** through **506.40**.

17) **LLOY.L** – 4-week base (12.6% depth) but volume contraction is poor (1.22x) and RSI is weak (47.6). Support: **50SMA ~100.12** and base low **100.11**. It stands out for strong longer-term trend and proximity to pivot. Needs **base tightening** and volume behavior improvement.

18) **BK** – 6-week base (8.4% depth) with acceptable close position; volume contraction slightly fails (0.96x). Support: **50SMA ~117.79** and base low **114.80**. It stands out for tightness near highs, but RS module fails (benchmark issue). Needs **volume expansion** above **125.33**.

19) **STT** – 6-week base (10.2% depth) with contraction (0.89x) and decent close position. Support: **50SMA ~128.27** and base low **123.12**. It stands out as a liquid financial with a valid base, but RS module fails and volume dry-up is weak (1.19x). Needs a **clean breakout** above **137.05**.

20) **ROST** – 6-week base (8.2% depth) but volume contraction fails (1.14x) and RS module fails. Support: **50SMA ~184.87** and base low **179.02**. It stands out because the base is not deep and price is tight near highs. Needs **RS confirmation** and volume expansion through **194.92**.

## PRE-BREAKOUT WATCHLIST (Top candidates from your PRE-BREAKOUT SETUPS list)

Criteria here: **distance to pivot small**, **valid base**, **better contraction/close position**, and fewer red flags. (Many items are graded B and/or fail base quality; I’m prioritizing the best-positioned.)

# FULL A/A LIST — DETAILED SEPA ANALYSIS (per stock)

> **Note on RS failures:** Many “RS not outperforming benchmark” show **0.00% returns** for both stock and benchmark (data artifact). I will still respect your scanner output: if RS/Relative Strength is flagged failed, I treat it as **not A+** and a **key missing criterion**.

---

## LLY — Eli Lilly (Grade A)
1) **Overall assessment:** Agree with **A (not A+)**. Trend/base are strong, but RS module fails and it’s not in breakout.  
2) **Why not A+:** **RS/RSI fail** (RS rating 50, RSI 54.9, not outperforming benchmark) + **breakout rules fail** (not ≥2% above pivot) + “heavy sell volume detected.”  
3) **Stage 2?** Yes (price above rising 50/150/200; proper order).  
4) **Base quality:** Valid 6w base, depth 12.4% (good), contraction 0.78x (good).  
5) **Relative strength:** Flagged weak (fails).  
6) **Volume:** Base contraction good; but sell-volume warning.  
7) **Breakout validation:** Not breaking out (below 1133.95).  
8) **Risks:** Late-stage risk (very near 52W high), sell-volume overhead, high D/E, valuation risk.  
9) **Recommendation:** **Half (pilot) only on breakout**; otherwise **None** until it clears pivot with volume.  
10) **Levels:** Pivot **1133.95**; Buy zone **1133.95–1156.63**; Tight stop **1077.25**; Base low stop **993.58**; **Last strong base/support:** 200SMA **859.16** (disaster reference); T1 **1247.34**; T2 **1644.23**.

## What I would do next (SEPA execution plan)
- **No buys until breakout confirmation**: require **close ≥ pivot + 2%** and **volume ≥ 1.2x** (ideally 1.4x+) with a strong close (upper 30% of range).
- **Best “ready now” names** (closest to SEPA-ready): **HSBA.L, INGA.AS, GLE.PA, SAN.MC, BBVA.MC, ROG.SW**.
- **Most actionable pre-breakout tightness** (from watchlist): **EXAS, FOLD, GTLS** — but only if they break with volume (tight bases can fail without demand).

If you want, I can also:
1) compute a **SEPA-style “Setup Score”** (0–100) using your checklist fields, and/or  
2) propose **position sizing by volatility** (ATR-based) rather than the scanner’s generic “Half.”
