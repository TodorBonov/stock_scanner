## TOP 20 PICKS — DETAILED SUMMARY (ranked by SEPA quality *from your A/A+ list only*)

**Important context:** Your A/A+ universe here is heavily skewed toward **“near-pivot / not yet in breakout”** situations (Breakout Rules mostly failing because price has not cleared pivot by +2% with volume). In Minervini/SEPA terms, most are **candidates**, not actionable breakouts yet. Rankings below therefore emphasize: **(1) base validity/shape, (2) RS/leadership vs local benchmark when available, (3) volume dry-up quality, (4) proximity to pivot with clean risk levels**, and (5) fewer “scanner red flags” (e.g., no RS failures, no heavy sell volume flags, no base-quality failures).

### Top 20 table

### Brief narrative notes for each TOP 20 (3–4 sentences each)

1) **SAN.MC** – The current 6-week base is tight and within elite depth parameters, with strong closes (avg close position 63%). The **base low 9.93** is the logical swing stop; nearer-term support is the **50SMA ~10.18**. It stands out due to **RS Rating 100** and clear outperformance vs ^IBEX. Watch for the scanner’s **“heavy sell volume before breakout”** flag—ideally you want a clean, high-volume thrust through **11.26** and a strong close.

2) **INGA.AS** – A clean 6-week base (10.7% depth) with strong closes (65% of range) and RSI 68 suggests constructive accumulation. The **base low 23.61** is the natural “roomier” stop; 50SMA support sits near **24.10**. It stands out as one of the few with **RS 100** and no major base defects. Watch for a decisive close above **26.44** with volume expansion (your data shows no breakout volume yet).

3) **GLE.PA** – Valid 6-week base (13% depth) and strong RS/RSI (RS 100, RSI 67) fit a classic SEPA “ready” profile. The **base low 67.32** is the swing stop; 50SMA near **68.54** is the first moving-average support. It stands out due to strong benchmark outperformance vs ^FCHI. Concern: **volume contraction in base is slightly weak (0.99x)**—ideally you want more dry-up before the breakout.

4) **CBK.DE** – Tight 6-week base (10.2% depth) with acceptable closes (54%) and RS 100. The **base low 33.44** is the logical stop; 50SMA support is **34.95**. It stands out for RS leadership and a relatively “textbook” base versus many others here. Watch for a clean push through **37.24** with volume >1.2x–1.5x.

5) **RR.L** – Strong long-term advance and proper MA stack (50>150>200) with a 6-week base of manageable depth (13.4%). The **base low 1131** is the swing stop; 50SMA support is **1188**. It stands out for powerful 52-week strength and strong volume contraction metrics, but the base is **not “high and tight” in closes** (avg close position 47% fails). Watch for a decisive breakout above **1306.6**; also note the scanner’s “late stage” caution (very near 52w high).

6) **HSBA.L** – A valid 6-week base (11.5% depth) with good volume contraction (0.66x) and RSI 67. The **base low 1168** is the swing stop; 50SMA at **1191** is near-term support. It stands out as one of the cleaner UK financial bases with decent RS (81). Concern is simply that it’s **not in breakout** yet—needs a strong close above **1320.4**.

7) **KGF.L** – Valid base and strong RSI (71) with positive RS vs ^FTSE. The **base low 310.3** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **319.75**. It stands out because it actually meets most technical structure requirements and has decent contraction. Watch the **heavy sell volume** flag—breakout quality matters.

8) **BARC.L** – Tight base (9% depth) and good contraction (0.74x) but RSI is weak (48.8), suggesting less momentum than top picks. The **base low 461.05** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **469.13**. It stands out for base tightness and proximity to pivot. Needs momentum/RS improvement and a real breakout through **506.4**.

9) **NOVN.SW** – Strong RSI (77) and clean trend structure, but **volume contraction fails** (1.19x) which is not SEPA-ideal. The **base low 107.68** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **111.54**. It stands out as a defensive “quality name” near highs. Watch for volume dry-up improvement and a decisive move through **121.4**.

10) **ROG.SW** – Similar to Novartis: trend is constructive, base is valid, but **RSI is only 55.7** and volume contraction is borderline. The **base low 323.2** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **333.17**. It stands out for stability and orderly structure. Needs stronger momentum + breakout confirmation above **362.3**.

11) **UCB.BR** – Good base depth (13.9%) and strong contraction (0.48x) with price near highs. The **base low 232.5** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **249.29**. It stands out for strong trend and decent base behavior. The big issue is **RSI at base start was very weak (35.7)**—suggesting the base may have formed after a less-ideal momentum phase.

12) **EVN.VI** – Tight 6-week base (10.3%) with good closes (64.8%) and contraction (0.88x). The **base low 26.6** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **27.76**. It stands out as a clean utility base near pivot. Concern: **RSI at base start was low (43.4)** per scanner.

13) **NG.L** – Valid base (12.7%) with contraction (0.90x) and very strong current RSI, but base-start RSI failed. The **base low 1135.5** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **1177.9**. It stands out as a defensive utility near highs. Watch for a proper breakout above **1301** with volume.

14) **IBE.MC** – Tight base (8.1%) but **volume contraction fails badly (1.45x)**—not the “quiet” base you want. The **base low 18.06** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **18.32**. It stands out for strong RSI and positive RS vs ^IBEX. Needs volume to dry up and then a clean push through **19.66**.

15) **PZU.WA** – Tight 4-week base (7.5%) with acceptable contraction (0.90x). The **base low 67.28** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **67.65**. It stands out for strong earnings growth and decent RS. Concern: **RSI at base start slightly under threshold** and breakout confirmation is absent.

16) **LLOY.L** – Base is valid, but **volume expands in the base (1.26x / 1.20x)** which is the opposite of what SEPA wants. The **base low 100.11** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **100.35**. It stands out for strong earnings/revenue growth and good RS rating. Needs a quieter base and a real breakout above **114.6**.

17) **FRE.DE** – Base is valid, but **volume contraction fails** and RSI-at-base-start barely misses. The **base low 46.3** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **48.4**. It stands out for being near pivot with a controlled base depth. Needs better volume behavior before a breakout attempt above **51.98**.

18) **CA.PA** – Tight base and positive RS vs ^FCHI; volume contraction is borderline (0.92x). The **base low 13.58** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **14.06**. It stands out because it’s one of the few consumer defensives with a valid base near pivot. Concern: **very low margins/ROE and high leverage**—not classic SEPA “superstock” fundamentals.

19) **TXT** – Valid base and trend, but **RS/RSI are weak** and volume contraction fails. The **base low 84.32** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **89.57**. It stands out mainly for proximity to pivot and aerospace/defense theme. Needs RS improvement and a clean breakout above **96.98**.

20) **GE** – Strong sector/theme and trend structure, but scanner shows **RS failures (benchmark/outperformance not captured)** and **volume contraction fails**. The **base low 290.07** is the swing stop; 50SMA is **306.39**. It stands out for institutional sponsorship potential, but technically it’s not “SEPA clean” yet. Needs a decisive breakout above **332.79** with real volume.

## PRE-BREAKOUT WATCHLIST (Top candidates from your PRE-BREAKOUT SETUPS list)

These are **within ~0% to -4% of pivot** and have a defined base. Since many are graded **B** (or have base/RS defects), I’m ranking by: **distance to pivot + base validity + volume signature + fewer red flags**.

| 9 | PZU.WA | PZU | 72.72 | -2.6% | Tight 4w base (7.5%) | Needs RS/volume confirmation on breakout |
|10 | XLC | Comm Services ETF | 120.40 | -2.3% | Tight 6w base (6%) | ETF: watch market regime + volume thrust |
|11 | AIZ | Assurant | 246.31 | -4.2% | Tight 6w base (6.1%) | Needs to tighten up closer to pivot first |
|12 | FRT | Federal Realty | 107.51 | -0.3% | Valid 6w base | Volume contraction fails; needs strong breakout day |

|17 | FR | First Industrial Realty | 60.79 | -1.7% | Valid base | RS weak + heavy sell flag; demand clean breakout |
|18 | ROL | Rollins | 65.03 | -0.5% | Valid 4w base; contraction good | Needs RS confirmation + volume |
|19 | DAY | Dayforce | 69.86 | 0.0% | At pivot; volume spike recently | Base quality fails (closes/volume); avoid if it “pops and drops” |
|20 | HI | Hillenbrand | 32.00 | -0.1% | Very close to pivot; volume increase present | Base closes weak; treat as lower-quality trigger only |

# FULL A/A+ LIST — DETAILED SEPA ANALYSIS (each stock)

> **Note on “RS failures = 0.0000 / benchmark return 0.00%”**: Several US/ADR names show RS as 0 with benchmark 0, which looks like a **data/benchmark mapping issue** in the scanner (it often uses ^GDAXI for US stocks). I will still grade them **as “not A+”** because your checklist explicitly flags “not outperforming benchmark,” but I’ll call out where this is likely a **data artifact**.

---

## RR.L — Rolls-Royce Holdings plc — **Grade A (Agree)**
1) **Overall Assessment:** Mostly agree with **A**. Trend structure is strong and volume contraction is good, but the base quality is not elite due to weak closes.
2) **Why not A+ (specific failures):**
   - **Base Quality failed:** Avg close position **47% (<50%)** = closes not near highs.
   - **Breakout Rules failed:** Not clearing pivot by +2% (not in breakout).
   - **RSI(14) only ~50** (below >60 preference).
3) **Stage 2?** Yes: price above 50/150/200 with proper MA order.
4) **Base valid?** Length 6w OK; depth 13.4% OK; **but closes weak**.
5) **RS strong?** RS Rating 100 and outperformance vs ^FTSE: strong.
6) **Volume:** Contraction good; no breakout volume yet.
7) **Breakout validation:** Not triggered (below pivot).
8) **Risks:** Late-stage risk (near 52w high), leverage metrics (Debt/Equity high), and base “loose” closes.
9) **Recommendation:** **Half** (as scanner suggests) *only on breakout*; otherwise **None**.
10) **Levels:** Pivot 1306.60 | Buy zone 1306.60–1332.73 | Tight stop 1241.27 | Base stop 1131.00 | Last strong support (prior consolidation / disaster ref): **562.02** | T1 1437.26 | T2 1894.57

## If you want this to be *fully SEPA-accurate* (and not constrained by scanner artifacts)
Two quick fixes will materially improve the quality of the RS judgments:
1) For **US stocks**, use **S&P 500 (SPY / ^GSPC)** or **Nasdaq 100 (QQQ / ^NDX)** as the benchmark (not ^GDAXI).
2) Provide **RS line trend / 52-week RS high** and **earnings estimates trend** (SEPA heavily weights accelerating earnings).

If you reply with:
- your preferred benchmark per region (US/UK/EU),
- and whether you want **only actionable breakouts** (already +2% above pivot with volume) vs **near-pivot candidates**,

…I can re-rank the Top 20 into a tighter “buy list” and separate “watch only” names more aggressively.
