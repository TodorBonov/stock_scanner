## FIRST: TOP 20 PICKS — DETAILED SUMMARY (ranked by SEPA quality *from your A/A+ list*)

**Important context:** none of the names in your A/A+ list are in a *confirmed breakout* per your own “Breakout Rules” blocks (all show “Clears Pivot ≥2% above: ✗”). So these “Top 20” are **best-in-class *actionable candidates*** (tight bases, strong trend structure, better RS/volume characteristics) **to buy *only on a proper breakout*** (ideally +2% through pivot with volume expansion).

### Brief narratives (Top 20)
1) **SAN.MC** – 6-week base with controlled 11.8% depth and strong average close position (61%). Last strong support is the **50SMA ~10.15** and base low **9.93** for a wider stop. Stands out for **RS Rating 100** and already **1.45x recent volume** (needs it on the breakout day). Watch: EU bank macro/news; ensure a **decisive close above 11.26**.

2) **CBK.DE** – 6-week base, shallow 10.2% depth, good closes (54%). Support: **50SMA 34.88** then base low **33.44**. Stands out for **RS Rating 100** and clean MA stack (50>150>200). Watch for **volume ≥1.4x** on a push through **37.24**.

3) **GLE.PA** – 6-week base, 13% depth, strong closes (61.7%). Support: **50SMA 68.24** and base low **67.32**. Stands out for **RS Rating 100 + RSI 66**, and the tape already shows **1.45x recent volume** (but scanner flags **heavy sell volume**—needs to be absorbed). Watch for a clean breakout above **77.34** without reversal.

4) **HSBA.L** – 6-week base, 11.9% depth, good contraction (0.67x). Support: **50SMA 1186** and base low **1163**. Stands out for **RS outperformance** and strong RSI (70). Concern: breakout volume currently muted; require **power volume** through **1320.40**.

5) **INGA.AS** – 6-week base, 10.7% depth, strong closes (62.6%). Support: **50SMA 24.02** and base low **23.61**. Stands out for **RS Rating 100** and strong trend structure. Watch for volume confirmation (current “volume increase” only ~1.0x).

6) **BBVA.MC** – 6-week base, 12.2% depth, excellent contraction (0.51x). Support: **50SMA 20.16** and base low **19.61**. Stands out for **drying volume** and **1.45x recent volume**, but RSI is weak (48.7) and “heavy sell volume” flagged. Watch for RS/RSI improvement and a clean push through **22.33**.

7) **BARC.L** – 6-week base, tight 9% depth, good contraction (0.73x). Support: **50SMA 468** and base low **461.05**. Stands out as a cleaner base than many banks here. Watch for breakout volume (currently ~0.95x).

8) **RR.L** – 6-week base 13.4% depth; contraction is good (0.73x) but **avg close position 47.2%** is sub-par (more churn). Support: **50SMA 1184** and base low **1131**. Stands out for **RS Rating 100** and strong prior uptrend. Watch for a tight close near highs on breakout day.

9) **ROG.SW** – 4-week base, 8.6% depth, excellent closes (68.9%). Support: **50SMA 332** and base low **331.20**. Stands out for base tightness/structure, but RSI is only 57 and volume thrust is lacking. Watch for RSI to firm and volume to expand through **362.30**.

10) **NOVN.SW** – 6-week base 11.3% depth with strong RSI (76). Support: **50SMA 111** and base low **107.68**. Stands out as defensive healthcare with trend strength, but base volume contraction fails (1.20x). Watch for a true “quiet” base week then breakout.

11) **SAF.PA** – 6-week base 11.1% depth, decent closes. Support: **50SMA 303.94** and base low **293.10**. Stands out as aerospace leader, but **RS/RSI fail** and volume doesn’t dry. Watch for RS improvement and a decisive reclaim of **329.80**.

12) **PZU.WA** – 4-week base 7.5% depth; structure is tight. Support: **50SMA 67.47** and base low **67.28**. Stands out for tightness and trend, but RSI is just under threshold and volume dry-up fails. Watch for a quiet pullback and then volume surge through **72.72**.

13) **RY** – 6-week base, very tight 5.5% depth. Support: **50SMA 167.05** and base low **164.95**. Stands out for tightness, but scanner RS block is unreliable (benchmark issue) and volume contraction fails. Watch for a clean volume signature on breakout.

14) **TD** – 6-week base 6.1% depth. Support: **50SMA 92.57** and base low **92.22**. Stands out for tightness but volume contraction is poor and RS block unreliable. Watch for volume expansion through **98.18**.

15) **BNS** – 6-week base 7.6% depth. Support: **50SMA 73.25** and base low **71.63**. Stands out for tightness, but volume contraction is very poor (1.60x). Watch for a “dry-up” week before attempting.

16) **LLOY.L** – 4-week base 12.6% depth, good closes. Support: **50SMA 100.21** and base low **100.11**. Stands out for strong prior run, but base volume contraction fails badly. Watch for volume to quiet and then surge through **114.60**.

17) **ECL** – 6-week base 11% depth, good closes and contraction (0.72x). Support: **50SMA 271.30** and base low **259.14**. Stands out for better base volume behavior than most non-bank names here, but RS block shows benchmark issue. Watch for breakout volume ≥1.4x through **291.08**.

18) **TXT** – 6-week base 13.1% depth, acceptable closes. Support: **50SMA 89.31** and base low **84.32**. Stands out for strong earnings/revenue growth, but volume contraction fails. Watch for tightening and a clean push through **96.98**.

19) **WWD** – 4-week base but **deep (21.9%)**—still valid, but not “elite.” Support: **50SMA 319** and base low **314.90**. Stands out for strong fundamentals, but needs better base volume behavior and RS confirmation. Watch for a high-volume breakout through **403.31**.

20) **ROST** – 6-week base 8.2% depth, decent closes. Support: **50SMA 184.92** and base low **179.02**. Stands out for tightness, but RS/RSI in scanner block are weak. Watch for RS improvement and volume expansion through **194.92**.

# THEN: Detailed SEPA analysis — for each stock in the full A/A list

> **Common theme across almost all A names:** Trend/structure is generally fine (Stage 2 characteristics), but **breakout confirmation is missing** (not +2% through pivot) and **volume contraction/dry-up often fails**. That’s why these are mostly **A not A+** in a strict Minervini sense.

---

## SAF.PA — Safran SA (Grade A)
1. **Overall assessment:** Agree with **A** (not A+). Trend structure is strong (above rising 50/150/200 with proper MA order), and base depth is tight (11.1%).  
2. **Why not A+:**  
   - **Relative Strength/RSI failure:** RSI(14) 48.1 and RSI at base start 52.1 (<60).  
   - **Volume contraction failure:** base contraction 1.25x / 1.13x (not drying).  
   - **No breakout:** not clearing pivot 329.80 by +2%.  
3. **Stage 2?** Yes, structurally Stage 2 (MA stack + distance from lows). Slight “late-stage” risk flagged (near 52W high historically).  
4. **Base quality:** Valid 6w base, 11.1% depth (good).  
5. **RS:** Outperforming benchmark, but momentum/RSI weak per scanner.  
6. **Volume:** Not contracting; breakout volume not present.  
7. **Breakout validation:** Not in breakout.  
8. **Key risks:** Failed breakout attempts near highs; aerospace news/cycle; weak momentum.  
9. **Recommendation:** **Half (only on breakout)**; otherwise **None** until RS/volume improve.  
10. **Levels:** Pivot **329.80**; Buy zone **329.80–336.40** (max +2%); Tight stop **313.31**; Base low stop **293.10**; **Last strong base/support:** 200SMA **286.89** (disaster reference); T1 **362.78**; T2 **478.21**.

---

## RR.L — Rolls-Royce (Grade A)
1. **Overall assessment:** Agree with **A**. Strong trend and RS Rating 100, but base “tightness of closes” is lacking.  
2. **Why not A+:**  
   - **Base quality failure:** Avg close position **47.2%** (<50).  
   - **No breakout:** not +2% through 1306.60.  
   - Breakout volume not present.  
3. **Stage 2?** Yes (clean MA stack). Late-stage risk flagged (very near highs).  
4. **Base quality:** 6w, 13.4% depth OK; but closes are mid-range (choppy).  
5. **RS:** Excellent (RS Rating 100), though RSI currently 48.7 (momentum cooled).  
6. **Volume:** Contraction good (0.71x), but no breakout volume.  
7. **Breakout:** Not triggered.  
8. **Risks:** Choppy base; aerospace/defense headline risk; false breakout.  
9. **Recommendation:** **Half on breakout** only.  
10. **Levels:** Pivot **1306.60**; Buy **1306.60–1332.73**; Tight stop **1241.27**; Base low stop **1131.00**; Last strong support **SMA200 1055.91**; T1 **1437.26**; T2 **1894.57**.

---

## CBK.DE — Commerzbank (Grade A)
1. **Overall assessment:** Agree with **A** (borderline A-/A).  
2. **Why not A+:**  
   - **RSI(14) 56** (<60).  
   - **No breakout** through 37.24 (+2%).  
   - Breakout volume not present (volume increase 1.00x).  
3. **Stage 2?** Yes.  
4. **Base quality:** 6w, 10.2% depth, good closes—solid.  
5. **RS:** Strong (RS Rating 100; outperforming).  
6. **Volume:** Contraction acceptable (0.77x), but breakout volume absent.  
7. **Breakout:** Not triggered.  
8. **Risks:** Bank macro sensitivity; false breakout without volume.  
9. **Recommendation:** **Half on breakout**.  
10. **Levels:** Pivot **37.24**; Buy **37.24–37.98**; Tight stop **35.38**; Base low stop **33.44**; Last strong support **SMA200 31.38**; T1 **40.96**; T2 **54.00**.

6. **Volume:** Recent volume increase 1.45x is constructive, but distribution flag matters.  
7. **Breakout:** Not triggered.  
8. **Risks:** Distribution near highs; bank macro.  
9. **Recommendation:** **Half on breakout**; consider smaller if sell-volume persists.  
10. **Levels:** Pivot **77.34**; Buy **77.34–78.89**; Tight stop **73.47**; Base low stop **67.32**; Last strong support **SMA200 56.16**; T1 **85.07**; T2 **112.14**.

# Notes / execution rules (SEPA-style)
- **Do not anticipate**: your dataset shows **no valid breakout entries yet** (no +2% pivot clears).  
- Prefer breakouts where:  
  1) price clears pivot by **2%+**,  
  2) closes in the **top 25% of the day’s range**,  
  3) volume is **≥1.4x** 20-day average (or at least clearly above base average),  
  4) RS line is making new highs (or very near).

If you want, I can also:
- **Re-rank the Top 20** using a strict numeric SEPA score (trend + base + RS + volume + breakout readiness), or
- Build **exact buy zones** (pivot to pivot+2%) and position sizing based on a fixed portfolio risk (e.g., 0.5%–1.0% per trade).
