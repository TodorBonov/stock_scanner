## TOP 20 PICKS — Detailed Summary (ranked by SEPA quality *from your A/A+ list*)

**Important context:** Your A/A+ universe here contains **no confirmed breakouts** (all fail the “clears pivot by ≥2%” rule). So these “Top 20” are **best *actionable* candidates** based on: (1) clean Stage 2 structure, (2) base depth/length quality, (3) RS/RS Rating where available, and (4) volume behavior (dry-up vs not). **Entries are listed at the pivot** (trigger), not “buy now.”

> Tight stop = **5% below pivot** (per your instruction).  
> Base-low stop = **at/just below current base low** (per your data).  
> Risk/Reward uses Target 1 = +10% vs Tight stop risk (~5%) ≈ **2.0R** (scanner-provided).

### Brief narratives (Top 20)

1) **HSBA.L** – Base is a proper 6-week, ~12% depth consolidation with strong MA alignment (50>150>200) and price near highs—classic Stage 2 continuation posture. Last strong support is the **50SMA ~1186** and the **base low 1163** for a wider stop. It stands out because it’s one of the few with **RS passing** and a clean volume contraction signature. Watch for a **decisive close > pivot +2%** with volume expansion (currently not present).

2) **INGA.AS** – 6-week base, ~11% depth with closes in the upper half and tight proximity to pivot. Support is **base low 23.61** and then **50SMA ~24.01**. It stands out with **RS Rating 100** and outperformance vs AEX. Concern: breakout volume is currently muted; require a true expansion day.

3) **GLE.PA** – 6-week base, ~13% depth, good average close position and strong RS/RS Rating. Support: **base low 67.32** then **50SMA ~68.20**. Stands out for **RS Rating 100** and strong prior advance (Stage 2). Watch for “heavy sell volume before breakout” flag—avoid if breakout occurs on weak/average volume.

4) **SAN.MC** – 6-week, ~12% base with constructive closes and strong RS Rating 100. Support: **base low 9.93** then **50SMA ~10.15**. Stands out for consistent outperformance vs IBEX. Concern: breakout volume ratio just under requirement (1.34x vs 1.4x); insist on a real surge.

5) **LLOY.L** – 4-week base, ~12.6% depth; trend is strong and RS Rating is high. Support: **base low 100.11** and **50SMA ~100.24**. Stands out for RS strength but is downgraded by **poor volume contraction** in the base. Watch for a tight close near highs on breakout day (not just an intraday poke).

6) **BBVA.MC** – 6-week base with excellent **volume contraction (0.49x)**, which is a plus in SEPA. Support: **base low 19.61** then **50SMA ~20.15**. Stands out because the base is “quiet” (dry-up) relative to many others. Concern: RSI is low (47.7), suggesting momentum hasn’t fully reset bullishly yet.

7) **PZU.WA** – 4-week base, shallow (7.5%) and tight—good for low-volatility continuation. Support: **base low 67.28** then **50SMA ~67.48**. Stands out for clean structure and decent RS Rating (87). Concern: volume “not dry” flag in volume signature—prefer to see turnover fade into the pivot.

8) **WFC** – 6-week base, ~12% depth with acceptable close position and decent contraction. Support: **base low 85.61** then **50SMA ~90.81**. Stands out as a liquid leader candidate if financials rotate. Concern: RS vs benchmark is failing in your scan—treat as “needs confirmation.”

9) **ZION** – 6-week base, ~12.7% depth with good contraction and strong trend. Support: **base low 57.77** then **50SMA ~58.91**. Stands out for a clean technical structure and manageable risk. Concern: RS failing in scan; don’t pre-buy—wait for breakout confirmation.

10) **KEY** – 6-week base, ~13.4% depth with good contraction and strong trend. Support: **base low 20.17** then **50SMA ~20.78**. Stands out for tight risk parameters and proximity to pivot. Concern: RS failing in scan; breakout must be decisive.

11) **USB** – 6-week base, ~13% depth; trend is strong and orderly. Support: **base low 52.99** then **50SMA ~54.00**. Stands out for liquidity and clean MA stack. Concern: volume contraction is poor (1.15x) and RS failing—needs a powerful breakout day.

12) **BK** – 6-week base, ~8.4% depth (tight), good structure. Support: **base low 114.80** then **50SMA ~117.47**. Stands out for tight base depth (lower volatility). Concern: RS failing and volume not dry—wait for confirmation.

13) **BNS** – 6-week base with very shallow depth (6.4%), which can work well if it breaks with power. Support: **base low 71.63** then **50SMA ~73.06**. Stands out for tightness. Concern: volume contraction is actually worse (1.56x) which is the opposite of what we want.

14) **BMO** – 6-week base, ~9.1% depth; constructive. Support: **base low 129.70** then **50SMA ~132.50**. Stands out for tight base and liquidity. Concern: RS failing in scan; treat as secondary until RS improves.

15) **TD** – 6-week base, extremely tight (4.7% depth). Support: **base low 92.22** then **50SMA ~92.25**. Stands out for tight risk. Concern: volume contraction is very poor (1.51x) and RS failing—this is “tight but not quiet.”

16) **ROG.SW** – 4-week base, ~8.6% depth with excellent close position (70.5%), which is a real plus. Support: **base low 331.20** then **50SMA ~332.36**. Stands out for strong close positioning and defensive healthcare sponsorship potential. Concern: volume contraction in base fails (1.03x) and RSI <60.

17) **NOVN.SW** – 6-week base, ~11.3% depth; RSI is very strong (77.6). Support: **base low 107.68** then **50SMA ~111.20**. Stands out for strong RSI and steady trend. Concern: base volume contraction fails (1.16x)—needs a clean “dry-up” before breakout.

18) **PFE** – 4-week base, ~10% depth; MA stack is bullish and price is near highs. Support: **base low 24.56** then **50SMA ~25.31**. Stands out as a large-cap “turnaround” style base. Concern: RS vs benchmark fails and breakout confirmation is absent.

19) **RR.L** – 6-week base, ~13.4% depth with **RS Rating 100** and strong prior uptrend. Support: **base low 1131** then **50SMA ~1184**. Stands out for RS leadership. Concern: base quality fails on **average close position (47%)**—too much slop/volatility inside the base.

20) **EXAS** – 4-week base, ultra-tight (1.5% depth) right under pivot. Support: **base low 101.83** then **50SMA ~101.85**. Stands out for tightness and proximity to pivot (low “air gap” risk). Concern: RS fails and fundamentals are loss-making—treat as higher-risk, smaller size.

# Full A/A+ List — Detailed SEPA Analysis (each stock)

> **Note:** None of these are A+ in your data; all are **Grade A**. I’ll explicitly state what keeps each from A+ using your checklist failures (RS, base, volume, breakout rules).

---

## PFE — Pfizer (Grade A)

1. **Overall assessment:** Borderline A technically (trend/base ok), but **not SEPA-ideal** due to **RS failure** and no breakout confirmation.  
2. **Why not A+:**  
   - **Relative Strength failed**: “Stock not outperforming benchmark.” RS Rating 50.  
   - **Breakout rules failed**: not ≥2% above pivot; no breakout volume/close metrics.  
3. **Trend/Structure:** Yes—price above 50/150/200 with bullish MA order; near 52W high (late-stage risk).  
4. **Base quality:** Valid 4-week base, depth 10.3% (good), volume contraction passes.  
5. **RS:** Fails per scan (key issue).  
6. **Volume:** Base contraction ok; breakout volume requirement not met (not in breakout).  
7. **Breakout validation:** Not triggered.  
8. **Risks:** RS lag; “late-stage” proximity to highs; fundamentals weak growth.  
9. **Recommendation:** **Half or None** until RS improves and it clears pivot properly.  
10. **Levels:** Pivot **27.37**; Buy zone **27.37–27.92** (max +2% rule); Tight stop **26.00**; Base-low stop **24.56**; Last strong support/disaster **52W low 19.50**; T1 **30.11**; T2 **39.69**.

---

## LLY — Eli Lilly (Grade A)

1. **Overall assessment:** Structurally strong, but **not actionable** until it reclaims pivot; RS/RSI flags in scan are a problem.  
2. **Why not A+:**  
   - **RS failed** (not outperforming benchmark in scan; RS Rating 50).  
   - **RSI(14) 52.5** < 60 threshold.  
   - **Breakout rules failed** (not clearing pivot).  
   - Volume signature notes **heavy sell volume before breakout**.  
3. **Trend/Structure:** Stage 2 uptrend intact (above rising MAs), but extended/late-stage risk near highs.  
4. **Base quality:** Valid 6-week base, 12.4% depth (good).  
5. **RS:** Fails in your dataset (despite LLY’s typical strength—treat as “data says no”).  
6. **Volume:** Contraction good; but sell-volume flag is caution.  
7. **Breakout:** Not triggered.  
8. **Risks:** High valuation, potential volatility around news/earnings; sell-volume overhang.  
9. **Recommendation:** **Half** only on a clean breakout with volume.

2. **Why not A+:**

   - **RS part failed** due to **RSI at base start 52.1 < 60** and current RSI 42.7.  
   - **Breakout rules failed** (no pivot clearance).  
3. **Trend/Structure:** Stage 2 yes (above MAs, proper order).  
4. **Base:** 6-week, 11.1% depth valid, but “quiet” action missing.  
5. **RS:** Outperforming benchmark; RS Rating 73.7 (decent).  
6. **Volume:** Not drying up; breakout volume not present.  
7. **Breakout:** Not triggered.  
8. **Risks:** Weak RSI/momentum; volume not supportive.

3. **Trend/Structure:** Strong Stage 2, very extended from 52W low (late-stage risk).  
4. **Base:** Depth ok (13.4%), length ok (6w), but closes not strong enough.  
5. **RS:** RS Rating 100 (best-in-list).  
6. **Volume:** Contraction ok; breakout volume not present.  
7. **Breakout:** Not triggered.

## One clarification question (so I can tighten this further)
Your RS benchmark varies by ticker (GDAXI/FCHI/FTSE/IBEX/etc.), and many U.S. names show **RS=0 / benchmark return=0** (data artifact). If you confirm a single benchmark (e.g., **S&P 500 / SPY**) for U.S. stocks, I can **re-rank the Top 20** much more accurately and be stricter about true SEPA leadership.
